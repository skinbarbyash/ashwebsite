                <h1>MEET ASHINA WILLIAM-SURESHKUMAR</h1>
                <p>
                    Ashina William-Sureshkumar, the founder of Skin Bar By Ash, created her business
                    driven by her passion for skin. To her, skin is more than what's on the surface. Beauty is
                    so much more than what we see on social media. The last few years she realized her
                    skin, body was all changing, noticing new pigmentation, breakouts, stretch marks, hair,
                    bumps, you name it. So, she began looking into different products, services and fell in
                    love with the idea of helping others like her with changing skin. She wants to help others
                    understand the way their skin works and how internal and external factors can impact
                    our skin. She wants to help them on their journey to healthy, clear skin and help people
                    look and feel their best skin. She truly finds so much joy in witnessing the positive
                    transformations in her clients skin and confidence. Ashina wants to redefine the beauty
                    industry by creating a community of people who feel confident in their own skin.

                <h2>EDUCATING OTHERS ABOUT SKIN CARE</h2>
                <p>
                    I love being able to educate people on the importance of great skin care. Often people
                    do not realize how crucial it is to take care of your skin, so being able to put them on the
                    right track is so rewarding.

                <h2>HELPING CLIENTS</h2>
                <p>
                    Providing care to clients who have lived with their skin issues/concerns without help or hope was the beginning of my deep love for the process, and one that I cherish.

                <p>
                    Seeing my client leave with a huge smile and glowing face is a reward in itself, knowing that my work initiated it. Being an esthetician combines science with beauty to help create healthy glowing skin - and that's certainly something I'm proud of.

                <h2>AN EVER-CHANGING INDUSTRY</h2>
                <p>
                    I am so fortunate to be a part of an industry that is always growing and changing. With 
                    all of the advancements in skin care, there is so much to be learned. I have an intense 
                    passion for learning. Between industry pamphlets, books, trade shows, webinars, blogs, 
                    classes and websites, the opportunities to learn are endless. I am truly a believer that in
                    all professions, you must stay up to date with what's going on in the industry to be at the 
                    top of your game. The skin care industry is fast moving with advances, so continuing 
                    education is a must.

                <p>
                    There is no better feeling than finishing a treatment and seeing your client with beautiful, 
                    glowing skin - it makes absolutely everything worth it. You can be confident in the 
                    products you're using and the treatments you've been giving, knowing that your client 
                    will have lasting results because of you. Truly a very emotionally rewarding 
                    profession. Making people look good also makes them feel good; which makes me feel 
                    good. Happiness for all!
